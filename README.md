# Crackers the Coding Friend

This repo contains notes and code for building a small coding friend, **Crackers**. I hope this will inspire a future Pythonista.

## Why #MakeRobotFriend

*People and friendship matter.*

[Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/)'s Limor Fried, ladyada, and Mr. ladyada, pt, have inspired me for years
with their commitment and generosity to Engineering and Education. I'm
very happy to share their #MakeRobotFriend message with others.

## My Introduction to Robot Friends

At the [Open Source Hardware Summit 2013 at MIT](http://2013.oshwa.org/),
I had the pleasure of seeing some [RoboBrrd](http://robobrrd.com/)s created by Erin Kennedy aka *RobotGrrl*.
The RoboBrrds' gentle and friendly look instantly grabbed my attention. As these
robot birds were made of felt and craft materials instead of aluminum or
plastic, they had a friendly and whimsical look. Impy the RoboBrrd was
one of my favorites, and, through the beauty of open hardware, you can
[build your own](https://www.instructables.com/id/RoboBrrd/) too.

One cool fun fact that I didn't know until recently was that [Adafruit and
ladyada encouraged Erin to join the "Ask an Engineer" podcast and
demonstrate the robot birds](https://blog.adafruit.com/2011/11/15/make-your-own-robobrrd/). Fast
forward to 2018. Erin "RobotGrrl" Kennedy shared in a [recent interview](http://openhardware.science/2018/01/04/guest-post-journal-of-open-hardware-interview-series-andrew-pelling-in-coversation-with-erin-robotgrrl-kennedy/)
the **RobotMission** project. Bowie, the robot's nickname, helps communities
and people interested in Citizen Science use robots to learn and protect
the coastal environment. One of the highlights of my own work in open
source hardware and software was when Erin let me interact with Bowie in
a Southern California park. It was great fun and really neat to see the
DIY work that she had done with Bowie. :smile: :beach:

## Crickit

This year, Adafruit introduced [Crickit](https://learn.adafruit.com/hello-world-of-robotics-with-crickit) as a *Creative Robotics and Interactive Construction Kit* to work with my favorite teaching board
[Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) running [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-the-community).
Inspired by AdaBox 008, I started thinking about what Robot Friend that
I wanted to create.

## Crackers the Coding Friend

I've begun working on **Crackers the Coding Friend**. I love Python and
the Python community. My passion is empowering others to learn to use
software code to solve real world needs.

Often learning to code seems intimidating with all of the syntax and fear of breaking something, like the entire Internet. :wink: Whether you are
a complete beginner to Python and CircuitPython or an experienced developer,
I find it's helpful to have friends while coding.

The [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) workshops inspire people to code.
One of the popular gifts at the workshops is a small rubber duck given to each
participant. This rubber duck gives each person, a coding friend, that will
listen to the learner as they try to debug their code. See more info about [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) on Wikipedia.

## This repo

This repo contains my notes as I work on **Crackers the Coding Friend**.

## Dedication

A real duck, Crackers, who befriended my family on a trip to Costa Rica, is
the inspiration for this robot friend. Thanks to all of my Python, Jupyter,
and Open Source friends for encouraging me to combine my loves of learning,
building, and sharing. Heartfelt thanks to my
family for their love. If this friendly robot inspires even one person to
learn Python and join the community of Pythonistas, I will consider this
a huge success. Happy coding!
