# Encouraging words

- Hello. I'm Crackers. Do you want to talk with me?
- I can listen while you tell me what is going on.
- Hmm... I'm not sure. I bet we can figure it out together.
- Sometimes I make typos. Let's check if there is one in your code.
- Well that was unexpected. Perhaps we can think about this one step at a time.
- I think we can. I think we can. I know we can.
- Did we write a test? Sometimes that can help us figure out what isn't working correctly.
- My brain hurts. Let's take a little break. Things might look differently in a bit.
- I'm a bit hungry. Do you have any animal crackers?
- Wanna hear a joke? What time do ducks wake up? At the quack of dawn.
- Think of each function as a little duckling. We need to see if they know how
  to run correctly.
- Sometimes I use an editor with syntax highlighting since it helps me see 
  my errors a little easier.
- I'm sleepy. Crackers is going to take a short nap to recharge my brain.
- If it looks like a duck and acts like a duck, it's a duck.
- We might have to ask another friend for help.
- Hi. I'm Crackers. Let's try pair programming.
